This experiment of end milling is carried out on VMC end milling machine equipped with maximum spindle speed 8000rpm, three axes. The work material used was aluminium in the form of 50mm X 25mm X 10mm block. The machining parameter with considerably affect the surface roughness are identified as spindle speed (rpm), Feed (m/min), depth of cut (mm). The experiment was conducted using High Speed Steel (HSS) and Carbide cutting tool. Surface roughness of each was test on surface roughness tester Mitutoyo 178-561-12A Surface Roughness tester
